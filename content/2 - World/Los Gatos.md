- One of a number of identical suburbs on the outskirts
- Dish-like neighborhoods stacked on top of each other on the sides of skyscrapers
- All exactly the same just on different balconies (with homes, shops, parks, etc.)
- Each one is named after an animal
- Really trying to distance themselves from hyper technological thing, to create an idyllic suburban life, despite existing as a technological marvel

A set of identical suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of [[Altos Cielos]].
