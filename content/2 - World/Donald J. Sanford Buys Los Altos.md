- Renames it Altos Cielos
- Starts building more city on top of the city
- Weirdly obsessed with getting high (vertically, not drugs)
-  Thereâ€™s never any top, the skyscrapers will never stop being built

Los Altos, an average city in the San Gabriel Valley, was purchased by moon mining magnate, [[Donald J. Sanford]]. He then renamed the city [[Altos Cielos]] and began building it into a city of skyscrapers. Construction is still ongoing and will likely never stop.
