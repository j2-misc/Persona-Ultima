Originally androids were created to help with moon mining (and thus many androids were created by [[Donald J. Sanford]]). Eventually, and though no one can exactly explain why, androids gained sentience in an event called [[The Braindance]]. 

- Sentient androids are way ahead of even the most advanced technology
- How the hell did that happen, who did that?
- Did someone make the moon mining androids sentient??
- Conspiracy theory that sentient robots are aliens we found on the moon???
- Secret technology of the ultra rich trying to make androids to upload their consciousnesses to become immortal????
- Donald J. Sanford is an ANDROID/ALIEN/MUTANT!!??!!?!?
