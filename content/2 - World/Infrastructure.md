[[Altos Cielos]], being a city of immensely high skyscrapers with an obsession for constant growth, the infrastructure of the lower levels of the city can sometimes cause problems. Tremors from the bottom have their effects heightened at the top of the skyscrapers. Infrastructure is often an issue politicians platform on, but no one ever really has the guts to actually do the hard work and deal with it, because it's a tricky issue.
