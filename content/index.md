Welcome to [[Altos Cielos]].
# The Story So Far
Nothing ever changes in [[Altos Cielos]], and nothing ever will. The party formed around tracking down [[Nomiki]], an android girl who was being regularly bullied by [[Cassius]] and his goons, [[Gavin]], [[Louis & Robert|Louis, and Robert]]. Their investigation led them to the [[Student Store]] which housed a portal to the [[Mirror World]], where [[Nomiki]] was lost. There they encountered strange monsters, discovered magical powers, and met a man named [[Ara]].

Now the party just needs to find a way out.
