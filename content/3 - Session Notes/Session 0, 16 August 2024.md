# Group Creation
Brought together by fate? Seekers?
# Character Creation
During the session, you may be presented with a situation and based on your responses, you will be assigned a major arcana. Otherwise, until you stumble upon your persona, you’re a normal every-day person. Think about what you want your persona to be like ahead of time. Typically personas are based on historical figures (see games for examples).
# Homework
