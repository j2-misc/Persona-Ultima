# Scene 1 : The Dream
Etan awakes, hearing the familiar ticking of tracks. Eventually, his eyes grow used to the dim light, and he sits in a Metrex car, with plush velvet seats and handrails to steady oneself. Sitting just ahead of him, however, was a blue table with a strange-looking man, balding with white hair, strangely thin proportions and a long nose.

"My name is [[Igor]]. Welcome to the [[Velvet Room]]. I'm delighted to make your acquaintance. This place exists between dream and reality, mind and matter. This is a room only those bound by a contract may enter, but it seems some strange fate awaits you in the near future."

"A contract?"

"A great ruin has begun to fester in the world. Left untreated it shall surely spell the end of everyone. Is this okay with you?"

"... No, no."

Igor smiled, "The ruin below you is far too great for human strength to overcome. Find bonds with others like you. Only with them will you find a way to change your fate. The night is waning. We will discuss this more another time."

Everyone had a similar dream, with the same words
# Scene 2 : A New Week
## Jaime
Jaime awoke the next morning, having experienced the same dream. It's the beginning of a new week. He blinked his eyes a bit, shook his head, dismissing it as just a weird dream. He was already dressed in shorts and a loose-fitting t-shirt. He did some stretches before heading out for a morning run.

The city was bustling, others jogging just like him, traffic starting up, the Metrex lines were already running. It seemed like just another day.
## Emanyel
The beginning of a new week. They were off to their morning shift. The sounds of a waking city began to flood through the window with what little light there was at this hour.
## Etan
A new morning. He stretched, did his morning calisthenics, went for a ride on his name-brand stationary bike. He texted Jaime, "You up yet?"

Jaime responded with a picture of the park he was at, "You know it"

Etan sent a picture of his bike with a caption, "I think my bike's broken, I'm not getting anywhere"

"Might have to take it in"

"That'll be my next stop"

Jaime then recorded a video of a golden retriever and sent it to Etan.
## Veronica
The morning is well on its way, it is a new week. She lazily checked the class [[Harmony]], same drivel as always. People not understanding an assignment having not read the outline, others complaining about the professor, and others still digitally milling about. She slept in longer.
## Jaime
As morning turned to noon, he finished his thirty miles and ventured back to his apartment, meal-prepping
## Emanyel
Was still at their shift. They were the only employee there at the moment. They saw some folks from school pass by, wondered what their lives were like, and decided not to say hi.
## Veronica
Tried to figure any more time left to stay in bed, but forced herself out of bed to get ready and head to class.
## Etan
Was on his way to his stats class. He was sort of on autopilot, standard affair for him in class.
## Veronica
After class, she took the Metrex higher up to the cafeteria.
# Scene 2: Afternoon
## Jaime
Was in his CS class, and he leaned over to the person next to him, "Can you believe they made CS a GE?"
"Eh... it's been like that for a while."
Jaime continued trying to brute force his way through the class, trying to write everything down because he knew he would have to look at it all again later.
## Emanyel
Was setting up for the next person to take over their shift, and on the way home, they began to just sort of wander. They considered grabbing a doughnut, but then remembered the girl they thought they were vibing with didn't work there anymore, so instead they headed to the discount grocery store.
## Etan & Jaime
After his afternoon classes, Etan was at baseball practice. He had his eye on Jaime, of course, as well as [[Louis & Robert|Loius]], the local bully. Louis had a reputation, him and his brother [[Louis & Robert|Robert]]. The [[Assistant Coach Alex]] threw a baseball glove over to Jaime when he appeared, "Glad you could make it! Go help Etan over there with his swing"
## Veronica
Found some food at the cafeteria and left for her dorm to eat there.
## Etan & Jaime
Etan offered to do some weight training with Jaime, but he had to refuse. He needed to eat before his next class. Etan asked how he slept last night, and after a pause Jaime answered, "Fine. Why do you ask?"

"I just had a weird dream last night. Metrex car, but it was really nice. Though, y'know, dreams aren't what you see, they're what you take from them"

"Some say dreams are a gateway to the soul. Could learn something about yourself."

"I already know everything I need to know about myself."

"You're one strong motherfucker. Anyway, grub's not gonna eat itself," Jaime started eating as he walked off to his next class.
## Emanyel
They'd closed up, grabbed groceries, subtly flirted with one of the [[grocery clerk]]. Once they got home they sent a [[Harmony]] message to [[Veronica|gRUngle_]] to ask if they wanted to play later, and after an hour they responded positively.
## Veronica & Jaime
Both were on the same Metrex up, one that would take Veronica home, and Jaime to his next class. Jaime was standing, still eating a tupperware of chicken and rice. Veronica was sat nearby, legs crossed, arms folded. At the far end of the car there was Robert and Louis, as well as the other two that normally accompanied them. Jaime recognized one of them as [[Cassius]], and he saw the last figure [[Gavin]] though he wasn't familiar with him. Veronica, though, was. 

Today, they were gathered around an [[Nomiki|android woman]] with fair complexion and light blue hair. She wore black dress pants and a lavender blouse tucked into it. The bullies were laughing, and the woman had a somewhat frightened expression on her face. She occasionally jumped. Cassius laughed and said, "C'mon, you should smile more!" She seemed to jump whenever Gavin--behind her--poked her with something.

Jaime walked over, finishing his food, "Can the four of you not take a hint?"

"Oh come on, it's none of your business."

"It's my business cause all the noise your making is bothering me and my meal. Maybe if you focused more on baseball you'd be a better player."

"Yeah, you're right. Come on, guys. Let's get outta here," and the four exited at their next stop. The woman sat down as soon as they left.

Jaime then asked if she was alright. One of her eyes, both a matte velvet color, seemed to be a little on the fritz. She blinked and it stabilized. "Did they do that?"

"No, it just happens sometimes."

"What's your name?"

"I'm [[Nomiki]]."

"Nomiki. Nice to meet you. And don't worry about anything those guys said, they're professional assholes. You go to school here?"

"Yeah, I'm in law."

Eventually, Jaime got to his stop and left. After, Nomiki made it to her stop, and so did Veronica.
# Scene 3: Evening
## Emanyel
Gave their regular performance at high-stakes karaoke. It went about as well as usual.
## Etan
Was back in his dorm, doing some post-workout stretches while his instant ramen cooked in the background. At the same time, he was watching a lore video on some old game.
## Jaime
After making it to class on time by the skin of his teeth, he headed back home. [[Reg]] had come home already, so some food had already been made. Reg made idle chatter and Jaime asked him, "Uncle Reg?"

"Yeah?"

"..."

"Well, out with it"

"Do you... ever struggle to do the right thing?"

"Y'know... sometimes... I do. It can be difficult, especially when people are already set in their ways. It can be hard to rock the boat."

Not having a big appetite, but knowing he needed to eat, Jaime cleared his plate.

"But why the question," Reg asked, "did something happen?"

"Ah nothing... it's just... had a weird dream. Had an awful day."

"Could be you need more sleep. I told you you need more sleep."

"I know."

"Now come on, you got a big day tomorrow don't you?"

"Yeah, first game."

"I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park."

"Thanks, Uncle Reg."
## Everyone
Eventually, everyone drifted off to sleep...
# Scene 4 : Morning
And woke the next morning.
## Emanyel
It was one of those days they didn't have much to do. They headed to the [[El Distrito de Arte|art district]]. There was a baseball game later that day, they'd catch it later.
## Veronica
Killed some time before classes grinding new artifacts in [[FULTIMA Online]].
## Etan & Jaime
Etan had a big day today. He prepared himself, packed up his baseball gear, and headed out the door.

Jaime read a book to prepare himself for the game.

Etan headed to the field about thirty minutes before they had to dress down. Jaime was one of the first to arrive.
## Etan
Before that, Etan had his entry-level biology class before the game that day, and on the Metrex over he noticed [[Louis & Robert]]. He noticed it was actually four people over there, crowded around someone. He got a better look, it was [[Cassius]] and [[Gavin]] around the person. Etan was familiar with Cassius, who vaguely reminded him of his folks. Fairly intelligent, but mostly conniving. He was out to get his own. No surprise they'd previously encountered him around [[El Cerebro]].

They were gathered around an [[Nomiki|android woman]], and Cassius said something along the lines of, "I mean, he could use all the luck he needs! He's got a big game today." Everyone else was just on their phones not really paying attention.

Etan half-sighed, "aw man," before starting recording with his phone, sliding it into the front pocket of his blazer and walking up, "Leve her alone, Cassius!"

The woman took advantage of the situation and left. Cassius exclaimed, "Wai- ugh..." and then turned his attention to Etan, "Nervous about the big game already?"

"No. How about you, Louis?"

"I'm fine," said Louis.

Cassius explained, "I'm sure Louis'll do fine, we were just finding a bit of extra luck for him, is all."

"Well you were just harassing a woman on the train," said Etan.

Two of the others snickered when he said that, and then Cassius said, "Right, right. Well good luck at the game. Maybe you'll do better than your profit margins."

Etan left at the next stop and eventually arrived at the locker room.
## Jaime & Etan
Jaime was already there. Etan asked him, "How you feelin'?"

"Ready to hit a grand slam."

Etan then explained the encounter on the way over, "those guys are scum."

"Don't know how you can change people like that."

"I don't know. People like Cassius are never gonna change. His family's got enough money to buy their own little world."

"Well hey, right now, it's just about us and the field."

"Alright... huh... let's play some baseball."
## Emanyel
Eventually made their way over to the baseball field. Not even the players were out yet. A few others were milling about, but most everyone was on their phones. Two players arrived late by player standards, both meeting the description that Etan gave them earlier. They were with two others, they laughed, and the players left. Emanyel managed to catch a snippet of the conversation.

"He has no idea. I mean he called her a 'woman.' I don't know where he gets that idea. I mean it's not a person."

Emanyel snarled as they passed by.
## Veronica
Wasn't paying attention to her online classes, instead mostly paying attention to grinding in FULTIMA Online. A Harmony notification went off in the class, reminding everyone about the baseball game. She was confused because this was a CS class, and she couldn't imagine anyone in CS being interested in baseball.
# Scene 5 : The Baseball Game
Jaime was a shortstop. The other team bunted, Jaime caught it immediately and tossed it to the third base, outing the rival player.
> 1d8 (6) + 1d6 (**6**)
> *A crit!*

Eventually, Etan was up to bat. Not incredible, but he made it to first base.
> 7

[[Louis & Robert|Louis]] batted about as well, making it to 1st, and pushing Etan to 2nd.
> Another 7

[[Louis & Robert|Robert]] absolutely beefed it. They didn't score a single point and the sides rotated.
> Snake eyes. Yeesh.

It came down to the ninth inning, they could jut barely cinch it. Etan was up to bat, Robert, Louis, and Jaime were on base. He could hear himself breathe. He remembered before the game, running into Cassius and his cronies. He remembered how Robert and Louis were suboptimal this game, and he reran what he wanted to do in that moment, but he stopped himself from doing. He took the bat and slammed it into Cassius's face and there was a deafening crack followed by the roar of the crowd as he hit the ball out of the park.

The team won.

During the game, Emanyel was was on the edge of their seat. They weren't fluent in baseball, but even they could tell that ending shot was amazing. They cheered louder than anyone else in the crowd.

Jaime jumped Etan as he made it back to home. A buzzing sense of jubilation filled the floors of the [[Sanford Multiplex]]. The team made their way to [[MgRonald's]], home of the year-round shamrock shakes and green fries. On the way out, Etan spotted Emanyel and wrapped his arm around them, "Did you see that?!"

"I fuckin' did! Awesome, man."

"We're all going to MgRonald's, you want in?"

"Yeah, sure, why not, if that's cool?"

"Yeah, man, we won!"

~~Etan said that his totally real girlfriend [[Hailey]] would be there, and she was totally real and she just went to school on a different floor.~~
# Scene 6 : MgRonald's
They ordered, and with Emanyel's outdated employee discount, it only cost them one zenit. Etan ordered a lot, Emanyel, got a shamrock shake (they didn't use real milk) and some fries (fried in vegetable oil). Jaime ordered four **quarter-pounders**. He called it the **whole-pounder**.

Eventually, Robert and Louis left, said their goodbyes to the team members they liked. Robert pointed to something on his phone, showing it to Louis. Then they quickly jogged off somewhere else. "Don't like that..." Etan said.

"Don't let them ruin our night," Jaime said.

"Can't do something about all the assholes. Gotta wait 'til they give you an opportunity."

Etan mentioned it'd been some time since they've seen Emanyel and they said that times were kinda hard after school. "If I could've afforded it, I'd have gone for a fifth year. Maybe video, or maybe game design... that was last on the list though. Music! Maybe music, that'd be fun."

"I was gonna say you could find classes for that on the net, but that doesn't really solve your problem."

"Yeah it's just... y'know when you're in college you sort your life into these blocks of time and once you're out you just have to sorta figure everything out."

Etan looked a little off, and Emanyel asked him about it. Something about a weird dream about being on the Metrex. Weird coincidence they both had a dream they were on the Metrex with blue velvet everywhere, the night before. Jaime chimed in that he had a similar dream as well.

They discussed it a bit more, and were increasingly weirded out by how much their dreams overlapped. Jaime stood up, Emanyel crouched down into a thinker pose. Jaime said, "Dude, I heard in this podcast, that they're putting stuff in the water supply that's messing with our heads!"

"Oh, man, you're not listening to those podcasts anymore."

"No- no it's not [[Roe Jogan]]."

"Is it [[Jalec Bones]]?"

"[[Pordan Jeterson]]?"
## Scene 6.5 : The Metrex
After some discussion, speculating that it might be some VR nonsense, Etan sent a DM to Veronica (She hadn't done anything all day) asking if she was available. She said she was, got dressed, and headed over to the MgRonald's.

Veronica, on the Metrex over to the MgRonald's, she saw [[Gavin]] and that other one. They were talking about something or other, but paid her no mind. She got to MgRonald's, ordered a shake, and went over to the others. Introductions were had. "This is Veronica, she's in my stats class"

"The one with the teacher you can barely understand?" asked Emanyel

"Yeah."

"I took that one too"

"But, anyways, we all had the same dream, and our best guess was some sort of VR latency."

They ran Veronica through the dream. She said it was probably a weird coincidence and quickly left because she recognized Emanyel (though they didn't recognize her).
# Scene 7 : The Metrex, again
Everyone was on the Metrex. On the far end of the car, they saw five people get on. Four of them were familiar. The first to step on was a woman with light-blue hair, who quickly found herself trapped in a corner. Emanyel saw this, snarled and started approaching, but Etan slowed them. "Calm down, cooler heads will prevail." Meanwhile, Jaime calmly walked past to listen to the conversation.

"Oh come on... they won the game, don't they deserve *some* kind of reward?"

Jaime tapped Cassius on the shoulder and said, "I got your reward right here," and as soon as Cassius turned around, Jaime punched him right in the nose.

Emanyel then took the opportunity to interpose themselves between the woman and the bullies. They noticed Gavin was holding something in his hand. Emanyel recognized it, it was a taser, typically used for self-defense but it'd been modified in some way. They quickly grabbed it, "what the fuck are you doing?"

Etan tried to think of who to back up, or rather how to calm the situation down. In that moment, Robert and Louis both went for one of Jaime's arms, trying to wrestle him down as Cassius recovered. Emanyel then used the last charge of the taser on Robert and Etan went for Louis. Jaime kicked Cassius, forcing him down. "You have no idea what you're doing, do you?"

"I know exactly what I'm doing," Jaime answered. "Now why don't you stay down?"

"This isn't going to change anything."

The doors opened, the woman ran out, Emanyel went to block the door after her so none could pursue. Robert went for a low tackle on Jaime, and Etan was locked in a struggle with Louis. Etan had a moment of clarity, pushed himself off of Louis and said, "alright, alright, alright, everybody calm down."

Jaime then pushed himself away from Robert, and the confrontation calmed down. Cassius said, "really you should just mind your own business."

"Or you could just stop being a dick, man," Etan said.

"Don't you guys have other things to do with your lives?" Jaime asked

"Of course we do, but you gotta enjoy some things, right?" Cassius answered.

Jaime said, "I bet I'd enjoy hitting you a second time as much as the first."

"This isn't how I saw my night going," declared Cassius. "We'll be leaving now. Let's see if this changes anything." Then they left.

Etan shook his head, "Jaime, you just punched the heir of one of the wealthiest families in [[Altos Cielos]]."

"That little turd?"

"Yeah. He's been a turd ever since we were little kids."

"Well, whatever. He doesn't own me."

Emanyel then noticed the prongs of the taser had been modded with a sharper, pointy end to poke into things that aren't flesh. They all felt bad for the android woman, but at least she got off the Metrex. *She was probably fine on her own*.

Jaime said he missed his stop, "I'm already late."

"What, you got a hot date?" asked Emanyel.

"Pft- wh- no, I don't- talk to girls," Jaime answered.

"Y'know I remember when [[Hailey]] and I had our first date," Etan said.

"Yeah, well this one's real," Jaime joked.

Once Jaime left, Emanyel mused that Cassius couldn't destroy his life because he didn't have much of a life left to destroy. Etan gave him an immediate pushback on that. They both agreed, though, that they needed to speak with Igor again, and figure everything out.
# Scene 8 : The Next Day
## Veronica & Etan
Veronica was up until 3 last night browsing forums and message boards. There was the usual nonsense (sanford trying to become immortal?? androids does is aliens??? giant sea monster *blurry ass photo*????). She saw a post about a sighting of someone with yellow eyes, that could shoot fire from their hands.

> *I saw them in the mirror.*

A few people were joking about it, but downvoted several times was a reply.

> *I've seen it too. It looked just like me.*

The reply stopped posting about a month ago, and the original poster stopped about six months ago. That seemed odd, as before that they posted semi-frequently. It wasn't until about a month before they stopped posting before they joined this specific forum. For both of them, they read similarly:

> 1: I saw a weird person with powers
> 2: They look like me
> 3: I see them everywhere (here it gets more frantic)
> 4: I'm afraid they're going to get me

In stats, Veronica shared all the information she gathered with Etan. They wished each other luck in class.

Unrelatedly but no less importantly, Emanyel's shift was worse, but they texted gRUngle_ that they'd be online later that night.
## After classes
Jaime planned to meet up with Etan after practice. They talked about when they'd talk to the coach about what happened last night.

Etan said, "You know, I admire your haste from last night."

Jaime sighed, "It was stupid."

"A little stupid maybe... but it was the right thing... well... it was what he deserved."
# Scene 9 : A Few Days Later
## During practice
[[Assistant Coach Alex]] was there, as were [[Louis & Robert]].
## Over the coming days
The four were laughing as always on the [[Metrex]], but no one saw [[Nomiki|her]]. *Nothing had changed*.
# Scene 10 : A New Week
## Group chat
A new monday, bright as it always is. Jaime went for his run. Emanyel stayed in, playing [[FULTIMA Online|FULTIMA]], they also sent a text to Jaime and Etan about what they'd do next.

> Em: Did that Vermecci girl say anything?
> ...
> Ja: Veronica?
> Em: Yeah, couldn't remember her name.
> Et: *link to the posts Veronica sent him*
> Em: Interesting
> Em: We should do something about Cassius. Did anyone see that android girl?
> Ja: No. Maybe they just stopped bothering her.
> Em: Maybe.
> Ja: I can ask about her
> Em: Good idea
> Et: What can we do about Cassius, Robert and Luis?
> Ja: I'm not sure
> Ja: If we don't find any hard proof of anything, I don't think the cops will do anything based off of our word
> Ja: Best we can hope for is that Luis and Robert get kicked off the team after we talk to [[Coach David|Coach]]
> Em: Well at least can anyone get in contact with the robot girl?
> Et: Did anyone get her name?
> Ja: I did
> Em: Cassius might not think she's a person, but android protection laws exist for a reason
> Ja: \*shivers\*
## Veronica & Etan
Looked into the posters she found earlier. One was [[Amalia Zunino]], a pharmacy tech student. On the [[Altos Cielos P.D.]] She was almost finished with her second year. The second person was a woman, [[Zinovia]], given the lack of a last name, she was likely another android. Similarly, she was also a student.

Veronica sent the relevant information as well as likely professors and sample schedules to Etan. While he was looking over it, Etan noticed that she would have been in a class with Etan, which was a class he'd shared with [[Cassius]].

Etan looked back through that class's [[Harmony]] to see if Zinovia was saying anything. She spoke very little at the beginning, but as the days went on she spoke less and less frequently. He'd ask other students about that later.
## The meetup
They met at the MgRonald's, Etan and Jaime got some food, and they all got on the Metrex to the library. Emanyel asked Jaime if he found anything on Nomiki. He hadn't found anything about her. "I really hope she's ok, I'm worried that they did something."

Eventually, they arrived at the stop where they last saw Nomiki. Etan felt compelled to leave, but he didn't. Emanyel looked out to see if she would be there, but she wasn't. This was the [[Student Store]]. It was fairly empty. "Maybe she works here."

Jaime said, "This was the first stop she could've gotten off at."

This was also the floor she got on from the first time Veronica and Jaime saw her. Emanyel got off, as did Etan (pulling Veronica with him), and Jaime followed.
## The Student Store
It was decently empty on the Student Store's floor. There was a worker there, stacking some boxes, bored-looking. It was about twice the size of an apple store. They asked the worker if he'd seen Nomiki.

"Yeah, she works here but she hasn't had a shift in a while. I haven't seen her in a week or so." After a pause to look around for a second, "You know who might know... I think [[Leela]] might know. She's the one who holds onto clothes outside the changing room."

Emanyel went up to Leela and tried to turn on the charm. "Hey..."

"You goin' into the rooms?"

"No, we were looking for someone. Nomuhkey?"

"*Nomiki?*"

"Yeah."

"She came in here about a week ago and said she needed a place to hide, she wasn't sure if she was being followed or not so I let her into one of the changing rooms." She pointed to one of the changing rooms, "so I gave her that one."

"Has anyone used it since?"

"No. Supposedly we're supposed to fix a leak in the ceiling there, I figured that'd be a good spot because no one would want to go into that changing room."

"Mind if I take a look?"

"... to see if Nomiki's there?"

"Yeah."

"... sure."

Emanyel walked in. There didn't appear to be a light, and there were some missing roof tiles. There was a full-length mirror on one side of the changing room. As they looked around, they noticed they weren't reflected in the mirror. They called Etan over, he couldn't see his reflection either. They touched the mirror and it rippled like water.

Etan called the other two over, and Emanyel touched the mirror again, reaching his hand in. "I'm goin' in," and without a second thought he went in. Jaime didn't hesitate to follow.

Veronica rushed out to get some rope.
# Scene 11 : The [[Mirror World]]
## Jaime and Emanyel
Entered into a room similar to the one they were just in, but it was off-kilter; sloped. Jaime turned around and pushed his hand through the mirror. They could exit at-will, it seemed. Him and Emanyel exited and waited for Veronica to return with some rope.
## Everyone
Etan decided...
- two tugs meant, "we need your help," 
- one tug meant, "we're coming back,"
- and a sudden yank out of Veronica's hands meant, "something bad happened"

Etan, holding the rope, as well as Emanyel and Jaime went into the mirror world, while Veronica remained behind with the other end of the rope. They made their way through a strange version of the Student Store. Words on the clothes were garbled, reflected in on themselves, and they made their way out to the platform. This city that stretched up and up into the heavens now stretched down.

"As above, so below."

In the abyss below, they could see the glints of teeth searching for the points of towers just out of their reach. The entire city was pointed down toward this deep purple water. Bits of building collapsed into each other, colliding without so much as a disruption.

They found a set of stairs leading up. Heading up, they found another strange colliding floor. It looked mostly like the Student Store except for the bits that refracted into places they shouldn't be able to.

"The longer we stay here," Jaime commented, "the more I get the sense this isn't where we're supposed to be."

The others suggested this might be what [[Igor]] had told them about, "where everything comes together." They decided to press on for as long as they had rope. They continued on until they heard a squelching noise. They snuck over to investigate and found a black blob with a porcelain mask.

Etan whispered to the others, "Guys what the fuck is that?"

Emanyel said, "It's a slime. A monster. After all we've seen, this doesn't surprise me that much."

"It should be a little surprising!"

Emanyel looked ahead and figured it was probably just the one. They suggested the group just sneak past.

With a successful group check, the party snuck back to the first floor. They heard the same squelching noise and tried to make their way around it, but then they felt a weight on the rope. Looking ahead, there was another one of the black blobs they'd seen earlier.

With a failed group check, the blob was alerted to the party's presence as they tried to sneak past it. Its porcelain mask tilted as if studying the party, before then approaching, and these strange pseudopods it used to move began to take the shape of hands. Its shape dematerialized before erupting into a new form, a pumpkin-headed [[Jack-O-Lantern|fiery spirit]] holding a lantern and cackling.
# Scene 12 : [[Jack-O-Lantern]]
It cast fire over their exit, severing the rope. Etan then heard a voice in his head, a splitting migraine carving through the depths of his psyche to the front of his mind. *"Is this the end of the road? The still darkness surrounds you and its servants intend to devour you. It is time for a new oath. I am **thou**, thou art **I**… blaze a trail through the **stagnation**, cut through the **sediment** and carve your way out of the **abyss**!"*

**"Sir Artorias!"**

Etan recalled the lore video he watched several weeks ago, a video about *[[Etan#Persona|Artorias, the Abysswalker]]*. Iron plates began to emerge and enshroud him. He leapt forward and slowed the monster.

*"Are we still undecided? The story has lingered on this page for too long now. Let’s form a new story together, I am **thou**, thou art **I**… open your eyes to the myriad of **possibilities** ahead of you. Linger on your canvas no longer, manifest the **change** within your heart upon the **world**."*

**"Jack of All Trades!"**

Emanyel recalled a story about [[Emanyel#Persona|a hero]] who could wield any weapon, but struggled to master any. He was adorned in a dragonscale-style black and red armor, each of his hands like small dragon mouths, purple goggles over his eyes.

A man behind him, a myriad of weapons on its back, pulled out a bow and fired at the monster.
# Scene 13 : [[Ara]]
After managing to dispatch the monster, the party heard a voice. "Hey, you guys are pretty good." The source was [[Ara|a shirtless man]], who asked them why they were here. Then he suggested they leave, "before [[Cipactli]] eats you."
