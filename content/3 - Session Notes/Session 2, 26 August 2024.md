# Scene 1 : Try not to let [[Cipactli]] eat you
[[Etan]] looked at his friends, "Let's go."

"Don't have to ask me twice," said [[Jaime]].

"Take care," [[Ara]] waved the party off.

"Be seein' you..." [[Emanyel]] half-sighed.

The party headed toward the mirror, or where it was last. Unfortunately, it wasn't there this time. The room had shifted, and they lost the rope in the fight. Ara approached again, "you good?"

"Where's the exit? It was here before..." said Emanyel.

"This place changes," Ara said. "Or at least it's supposed to."

"What did you do to the door?!" Jaime asked.

"I don't know, man, I just live here," Ara answered.

Etan looked out to the distance, and he saw other buildings shaking, and areas where floor tiles divided into themselves, like smaller versions of that shifting. It was as though the place was alive. Unfortunately, he didn't see the door.

"Well I can try to lead you out of here, but no promises it'll be an easy path," Ara said. "How many of you can fight?"

Jaime chimed in that he could. Ara sized him up and suggested he let the others take the lead. "You're not just fighting your own kind down here, you're fighting shadows." Jaime looked behind himself, and Ara explained, "Those blobby things. Those are shadows."

"You just have to put yourself out there," Etan said in a pseudo-british accent that even he was surprised by. Then, once Ara confirmed everyone was ready, he disappeared in a gust of wind. The three of them were alone and seemingly without guidance.

"We came in through a mirror," Emanyel said. "All we gotta do is find another one."

"Ideally the same one," Etan added.

"I think any will do."

"Well what if we end up in Australia? We don't know how this works."

"I imagine if it just looks like [[Altos Cielos]], it'll take us there."

Then, like a whisper behind their ear, they heard Ara's voice, "I think I found a way out. Go forward and take a left at the green coatrack. Right... up the stairs." They heard some squelching as they ascended the stairs, "it sounds like there's shadows on this floor. You're gonna want to get past them and find the next set of stairs that lead up."
# Scene 2 : Shadows!
The party tried to sneak past, but was *caught by a group of shadows!*
> [[Jack-O-Lantern|Jack-O-Lanterns]] x2
> [[Green Slime]] x1

Emanyel whiffed an attack, and Etan was still slow on the draw. A [[Jack-O-Lantern]] was about to strike Emanyel, and for Jaime, time began to slow... he saw the glowing hot ember of the lantern grow closer as he ran to interpose. A splitting headache crashed through his mind, and a voice from deep within the recesses of his psyche echoed through his head...

*"Have we pondered long enough? You have thought long about the state of the world, enough to lose your own mind. Let us form a pact. I am **thou**, thou art **I**… the tides of **revolution** crash against the palace walls. Use your **head** and lead the **change** that emerges from within your **heart**."*

**"Let heads roll! *Marie!"*** with this new power, Jaime interposed himself between his friend and the attack before then turning to Etan, encouraging him, "game's not over yet!"

Etan went next, studying the [[Green Slime]] ahead of them. After a round of combat, [[Ara]] called out, "if you need any help deciphering an enemy, I can help."

As the fight raged on, back at the changing room, [[Veronica]] slipped and fell into the mirror world, falling towards the party's location. Emanyel caught her, though she wasn't a fan. Etan studied one of the Jack-O-Lanterns, then Jaime encouraged Veronica, trying to calm her panic. Etan aided in the effort. "You're stronger than you think you are," Jaime said as he reached out a hand. She took it, calmer still, but she still hadn't formed a contract. "It's kill or be killed! We have to fight! And you have to fight with us! Like we did in that high school! Now is no different!"

As Jaime pleaded with her, she was panicked but strangely focused. There was that mind-splitting ache rushing form the depths of her psyche. A voice spoke to her, like her own, *"Has your luck run out already? A new hand has been dealt, and it must be played. Time for a new gamble, a contract. I am **thou**, thou art **I**… the strings of **fate** have begun to play a new tune. So let us roll the **dice** and see where they may **fall**."*

**"Persona!"**

Eventually, the party managed to best the creatures and Ara called to the party, "let's get you outta here!"
