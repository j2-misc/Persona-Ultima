# Tarot
You awaken from your sleep, and it seems you’ve already gotten dressed. The day lies ahead of you. You see your keys, an open window at the far end of the room, a plate of food, and your phone.

> Phone

Password?

> Yes, but it’s really simple

There are a few messages for you. Which do you respond to first?

> One from my boss, respond to it anxiously

The message is a little cryptic. Your boss wants you to cover someone’s shift, but not pressure you. Do you accept?  

> Yes

The hours will go late into the night. Are you used to staying up that late?  

> Yes, very much

Your mind begins to wander to what the rest of your day holds. How do you feel?

> Worried, hoping I can get through everything without something coming up that complicates my entire life

As you let out a nervous breath, how long until you leave your apartment?

> I want to say 15, but it’s more like 20. I need to leave in 15, but I’m late and rush

You leave at 20. You rush down the hallway. There appears to be a sign that seems to bar you. There’s a puddle in the way, you could step around it. What do you do?

> I step right into it

As you make your way through the rest of your day, you approach the beginning of your routine before your eyes close and you awake once more, this time in bed.

Emmanuel… or whoever you are… your arcana corresponds to the eighteenth. *That of **The Moon** (resist dark, vuln light).*

> About the Moon
> 
> Only appears in darkness when you are lost, the moonlight can dispel illusions or play tricks. Whether or not you can trust your instincts determines its position.
