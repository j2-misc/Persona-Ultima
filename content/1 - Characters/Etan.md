- Where am I in the city? If I’m not at [[Sanford Dorms]] reading manga or the [[Golden Secession Memorial Library]] studying I’m probably at [[Block Rave]] in [[Los Barrancos]].
- I’m a second year Econ major and I’m getting my minor in business, but I don’t really like my classes. I’m mostly interested in [[the baseball team|baseball]].
- I usually hang out with my underclassmen [[Jaime]], he’s like the little brother I never had. 
- [[Emanyel]] was someone who helped crack my shell when I was a freshman, I always admired their thirst for experience.
- [[Veronica]] is in my statistics class, she’s pretty cool and she takes good notes.

# Tarot
You awaken from your sleep. It seems you’ve already gotten dressed, and the day lies before you. On the table, you see your keys, there’s an open window at the far corner of the room, a plate of food lies uneaten, and at last your phone awaits you.

> Phone

Password?

> Yes

A few messages waiting, which do you respond to first?

> A few messages from parents, with the same automated signature. Responds the same way he always does: “Good. Studying hard. Resting. Love you.”

As you respond, your mind drifts to your studies. How go your classes?

> They go alright. Studying economics because my parents want to. Most of my classes are geared towards that. Took an elective this year in biology, really interested in that, especially since they started learning about zoology.

Eventually you return to your living room. The day awaits you. How long until you set out?

> Take some time, eat a plate of food, get ready, think about what I’m gonna wear, then set out lookin’ good

As you make your way out of your building, the usual route, the shortest way to the elevator, has a sign, something about a wet floor. Indeed there is a puddle, but it’d be possible to maneuver around it if one was careful.

> Initial instinct to find a way around -> eh, whatever I’m him I’ve got this

Through or around?

> Through

You move swiftly through. The rest of your journey to class is uneventful. Then your eyes open, you are in your bed, having truly awoken from your sleep finally. 

You are represented by the seventh major arcana. ***The Chariot** (resist bolt, vuln air).*
