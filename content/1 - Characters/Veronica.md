# Tarot
You awaken from your sleep, and it seems you’ve already gotten dressed. The day lies ahead of you. You are in your living room. You see an open window at the far end of the room, a plate of food, your phone  and see your keys.
  
> Pick up the plate of food and return to my bedroom

Your bedroom is hot not in an uncomfortable way but in a reassuring way, what do you think of?

> Let food get cold searching for a video to watch. 

Delve into the net looking for something to entertain you. A video catches your eye but you reject it. Why?

> IDK, the video is not introducing something new or information I don't already know.

You are bored by the videos' unoriginal messaging, eventually you find something that interests you. When you are finished eating do you pause the video or let it finish.

> Scroll down looking for something new to watch while the video plays.

What time do you leave?

> Realizing I have a class today, I check the class discord to see if it has been canceled, 

It has not

>Wait until I need to leave and go as late as I can.

As you make your way out of your apartment do you walk or take the metro

>I Walk

As you reach the door to your class your eyes close, and when your eyes open you are back in bed. Alignment: 10th Arcana, ***The Wheel of Fortune** (resist air, vuln earth).*

> About the Wheel of Fortune
> 
> Everything good and everything bad passes. The only thing you can control is what you choose to focus on.
# Persona

> *~ Gatsby*
