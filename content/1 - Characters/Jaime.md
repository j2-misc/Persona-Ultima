# Tarot
You awaken from your sleep, and it seems you’ve already gotten dressed. The day lies ahead of you. You are in your living room. You see an open window at the far end of the room, a plate of food, your phone and see your keys.

Which do you reach for first?

> Keys.

You pick up your keys. Do you have a keychain?

> No.

As you swipe your keys up, you are well aware of the day ahead of you. How long until you leave your apartment?

> Out the door now

As you make your way out, you turn around, you lock the door. Where are you headed?

> I’m headed to the beach

Do you walk or do you take the metro?

> I walk

As you walk, do you listen to anything, or do you walk with open ears?

> I walk with open ears

You move through the busy streets, people clamor up behind and past you. You approach a maglift which takes you to one of the beach floors. Why do you choose this beach?

> Because this beach has sea lions

You are met with glorious sun, fresh water, and of course, sea lions. Why are you here?

> Warm sand

You sit in the warm sand. As you sit, bask in its warmth, does your mind drift?

> Yes

To where?

> To the plate of food I didn’t eat

You wonder about that food even as you sit on this beach. How long do you stay?

> Probably not long, maybe like an hour

Eventually, an hour comes to a close. Where are you off to next?

> Back home

You return home, making your way back through the streets. As your hand reaches for the doorknob, your eyes crack, and by the time they open again you are back in your bed.

James… or whoever you are… you align with the ninth arcana, known as ***The Hermit** (resist earth, vuln poison).*

> About the Hermit
> 
> Strays from crowds, can find wisdom in isolation. In excess, this can reverse.
# Persona
> *"Have we pondered long enough? You have thought long about the state of the world, enough to lose your own mind. Let us form a pact. I am **thou**, thou art **I**… the tides of **revolution** crash against the palace walls. Use your **head** and lead the **change** that emerges from within your **heart**."*
> *~ Marie*
